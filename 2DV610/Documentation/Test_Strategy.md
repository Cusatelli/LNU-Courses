# Test Strategy
## Objective
The objective of the Test Strategy documentation is to define a strategy for evaluating the current state of a Web-Server
(“MyWebServer”) Application. The aim is to provide an estimation of how well suited this deprecated software is to use,
with minimal configurations to the source code & how easy it is to integrate with current modern day systems, in its current state.

## Stakeholders
A small Software Development Company (SDC).
“[...] SDC aims to redistribute this server on a wide range of Internet Of Things (IOT) to present information from sensors etc. 
SDC wants an easy to deploy java-web-server that can be deployed on many different devices and therefore that can attract attention 
of a wide range of IOT developers. IOT-developers want minimal configuration as well as easy integration and adaptation of the 
web-server. [...]”
