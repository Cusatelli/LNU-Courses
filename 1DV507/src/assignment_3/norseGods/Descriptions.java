	/* ************		LOKI	*************** */
	public final String LOKI_DESC = "Loki's relation with the gods varies by source; "
			+ "Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them. "
			+ "Loki is a shape shifter and in separate incidents he appears in the form of a salmon, "
			+ "a mare, a fly, and possibly an elderly woman named Þökk (Old Norse 'thanks'). "
			+ "Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the "
			+ "god Baldr and Loki is eventually bound by Váli with the entrails of one of his sons. In both "
			+ "the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, the goddess Skaði is responsible for placing a serpent "
			+ "above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects "
			+ "into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips "
			+ "in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset "
			+ "of Ragnarök, Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods "
			+ "among the forces of the jötnar, at which time he will encounter the god Heimdallr and "
			+ "the two will slay each other.";
	/* ************		THOR	*************** */
	public final String THOR_DESC = "Due to the nature of the Germanic corpus, narratives featuring "
			+ "Thor are only attested in Old Norse, where Thor appears throughout Norse mythology. "
			+ "Norse mythology, largely recorded in Iceland from traditional material stemming from "
			+ "Scandinavia, provides numerous tales featuring the god. In these sources, Thor bears at "
			+ "least fifteen names, is the husband of the golden-haired goddess Sif, is the lover of the "
			+ "jötunn Járnsaxa, and is generally described as fierce eyed, red haired and red bearded. "
			+ "With Sif, Thor fathered the goddess (and possible valkyrie) Þrúðr; with Járnsaxa, he fathered "
			+ "Magni; with a mother whose name is not recorded, he fathered Móði, and he is the stepfather of "
			+ "the god Ullr. By way of Odin, Thor has numerous brothers, including Baldr. Thor has two "
			+ "servants, Þjálfi and Röskva, rides in a cart or chariot pulled by two goats, Tanngrisnir "
			+ "and Tanngnjóstr (that he eats and resurrects), and is ascribed three dwellings (Bilskirnir, "
			+ "Þrúðheimr, and Þrúðvangr). Thor wields the mountain-crushing hammer, Mjölnir, wears the belt "
			+ "Megingjörð and the iron gloves Járngreipr, and owns the staff Gríðarvölr. Thor's exploits, "
			+ "including his relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with the monstrous serpent "
			+ "Jörmungandr—and their foretold mutual deaths during the events of Ragnarök—are recorded "
			+ "throughout sources for Norse mythology.";
	/* ************		ODIN	*************** */
	public final String ODIN_DESC = "Odin is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history "
			+ "of the Germanic peoples, from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania through the tribal "
			+ "expansions of the Migration Period and the Viking Age. In the modern period, Odin continued "
			+ "to be acknowledged in the rural folklore of Germanic Europe. References to Odin appear in place "
			+ "names throughout regions historically inhabited by the ancient Germanic peoples, and the day of "
			+ "the week Wednesday bears his name in many Germanic languages, including English." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"In Old English texts, Odin holds a particular place as a euhemerized ancestral figure among "
			+ "royalty, and he is frequently referred to as a founding figure among various other Germanic "
			+ "peoples, including the Langobards. Forms of his name appear frequently throughout the Germanic "
			+ "record, though narratives regarding Odin are mainly found in Old Norse works recorded in Iceland, "
			+ "primarily around the 13th century. These texts make up the bulk of modern understanding of Norse "
			+ "mythology." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"In Old Norse texts, Odin is depicted as one-eyed and long-bearded, frequently wielding a spear "
			+ "named Gungnir, and wearing a cloak and a broad hat. He is often accompanied by his animal "
			+ "companions and familiars—the wolves Geri and Freki and the ravens Huginn and Muninn, who bring "
			+ "him information from all over Midgard—and rides the flying, eight-legged steed Sleipnir across "
			+ "the sky and into the underworld. Odin is the son of Bestla and Borr and has two brothers, Vili "
			+ "and Vé. Odin is attested as having many sons, most famously the gods Thor (with Jörð) and Baldr "
			+ "(with Frigg), and is known by hundreds of names. In these texts, he frequently seeks greater "
			+ "knowledge, at times in disguise (most famously by obtaining the Mead of Poetry), makes wagers "
			+ "with his wife Frigg over the outcome of exploits, and takes part in both the creation of the "
			+ "world by way of slaying the primordial being Ymir and giving the gift of life to the first two "
			+ "humans Ask and Embla. Odin has a particular association with Yule, and mankind's knowledge of "
			+ "both the runes and poetry is also attributed to him, giving Odin aspects of the culture hero." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"In Old Norse texts, female beings associated with the battlefield—the valkyries—are associated "
			+ "with the god and Odin oversees Valhalla, where he receives half of those who die in battle, "
			+ "the einherjar. The other half are chosen by the goddess Freyja for her afterlife location, "
			+ "Fólkvangr. Odin consults the disembodied, herb-embalmed head of the wise being Mímir for advice, "
			+ "and during the foretold events of Ragnarök, Odin is told to lead the einherjar into battle before "
			+ "being consumed by the monstrous wolf Fenrir. In later folklore, Odin appears as a leader of the "
			+ "Wild Hunt, a ghostly procession of the dead through the winter sky. He is associated with charms "
			+ "and other forms of magic, particularly in Old English and Old Norse texts.";
	/* ************		BALDR	*************** */
	public final String BALDR_DESC = "Baldr is known primarily for the story of his death. His death is "
			+ "seen as the first in the chain of events which will ultimately lead to the destruction of "
			+ "the gods at Ragnarök. Baldr will be reborn in the new world, according to Völuspá." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"He had a dream of his own death and his mother had the same dreams. Since dreams were usually "
			+ "prophetic, this depressed him, so his mother Frigg made every object on earth vow never to "
			+ "hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow except mistletoe[7]—a detail which has traditionally "
			+ "been explained with the idea that it was too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking "
			+ "it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact that young "
			+ "people were not eligible to swear legal oaths, which could make them a threat later in life." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"When Loki, the mischief-maker, heard of this, he made a magical spear from this plant (in some "
			+ "later versions, an arrow). He hurried to the place where the gods were indulging in their "
			+ "new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki "
			+ "gave the spear to Baldr's brother, the blind god Höðr, who then inadvertently killed his "
			+ "brother with it (other versions suggest that Loki guided the arrow himself). For this act, "
			+ "Odin and the giantess Rindr gave birth to Váli who grew to adulthood within a day and slew "
			+ "Höðr." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"Baldr was ceremonially burnt upon his ship, Hringhorni, the largest of all ships. As he was "
			+ "carried to the ship, Odin whispered in his ear. This was to be a key riddle asked by Odin "
			+ "(in disguise) of the giant Vafthrudnir (and which was unanswerable) in the poem Vafthrudnismal. "
			+ "The riddle also appears in the riddles of Gestumblindi in Hervarar saga." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"The dwarf Litr was kicked by Thor into the funeral fire and burnt alive. Nanna, Baldr's wife, "
			+ "also threw herself on the funeral fire to await Ragnarök when she would be reunited with her "
			+ "husband (alternatively, she died of grief). Baldr's horse with all its trappings was also "
			+ "burned on the pyre. The ship was set to sea by Hyrrokin, a giantess, who came riding on a wolf "
			+ "and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"Upon Frigg's entreaties, delivered through the messenger Hermod, Hel promised to release Baldr "
			+ "from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. All did, except a giantess, "
			+ "Þökk (often presumed to be the god Loki in disguise), who refused to mourn the slain god. Thus "
			+ "Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnarök, when he and his brother "
			+ "Höðr would be reconciled and rule the new earth together with Thor's sons.";
	/* ************		FREYR	*************** */
	public final String FREYR_DESC = "Freyr (Old Norse: Lord), sometimes anglicized as Frey, is a widely "
			+ "attested god associated with sacral kingship, virility and prosperity, with sunshine and "
			+ "fair weather, and pictured as a phallic fertility god in Norse mythology. Freyr is said to "
			+ "\"bestow peace and pleasure on mortals\". Freyr, sometimes referred to as Yngvi-Freyr, was "
			+ "especially associated with Sweden and seen as an ancestor of the Swedish royal house." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"In the Icelandic books the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Freyr is presented as one of the "
			+ "Vanir, the son of the sea god Njörðr, as well as the twin brother of the goddess Freyja. "
			+ "The gods gave him Álfheimr, the realm of the Elves, as a teething present. He rides the "
			+ "shining dwarf-made boar Gullinbursti and possesses the ship Skíðblaðnir which always has a "
			+ "favorable breeze and can be folded together and carried in a pouch when it is not being used. "
			+ "Freyr is also known to have been associated with the horse cult. He also kept sacred horses in "
			+ "his sanctuary at Thrandheim in Norway. He has the servants Skírnir, Byggvir and Beyla." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"The most extensive surviving Freyr myth relates Freyr's falling in love with the female jötunn "
			+ "Gerðr. Eventually, she becomes his wife but first Freyr has to give away his sword which fights "
			+ "on its own \"if wise be he who wields it.\" Although deprived of this weapon, Freyr defeats the "
			+ "jötunn Beli with an antler. However, lacking his sword, Freyr will be killed by the fire jötunn "
			+ "Surtr during the events of Ragnarök." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Freyr is revived in the modern period in Heathenry "
			+ "movement.";
	/* ************		FREYJA	*************** */
	public final String FREYJA_DESC = "In Norse mythology, Freyja (/ˈfreɪə/; Old Norse for \"(the) Lady\") "
			+ "is a goddess associated with love, sex, beauty, fertility, gold, seiðr, war, and death. Freyja "
			+ "is the owner of the necklace Brísingamen, rides a chariot pulled by two cats, is accompanied "
			+ "by the boar Hildisvíni, and possesses a cloak of falcon feathers. By her husband Óðr, she is "
			+ "the mother of two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi. Along with her brother Freyr, her father Njörðr, "
			+ "and her mother (Njörðr's sister, unnamed in sources), she is a member of the Vanir. Stemming "
			+ "from Old Norse Freyja, modern forms of the name include Freya, Freyia, and Freja." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"Freyja rules over her heavenly field Fólkvangr and there receives half of those that die in "
			+ "battle, whereas the other half go to the god Odin's hall, Valhalla. Within Fólkvangr lies "
			+ "her hall, Sessrúmnir. Freyja assists other deities by allowing them to use her feathered "
			+ "cloak, is invoked in matters of fertility and love, and is frequently sought after by powerful "
			+ "jötnar who wish to make her their wife. Freyja's husband, the god Óðr, is frequently absent. "
			+ "She cries tears of red gold for him, and searches for him under assumed names. Freyja has "
			+ "numerous names, including Gefn, Hörn, Mardöll, Sýr, Valfreyja, and Vanadís." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"Freyja is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional "
			+ "sources; in the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, composed by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century; "
			+ "in several Sagas of Icelanders; in the short story \"Sörla þáttr\"; in the poetry of skalds; "
			+ "and into the modern age in Scandinavian folklore." + 
			"\n\n" + 
			"Scholars have debated whether Freyja and the goddess Frigg ultimately stem from a single goddess "
			+ "common among the Germanic peoples; connected her to the valkyries, female battlefield choosers "
			+ "of the slain; and analyzed her relation to other goddesses and figures in Germanic mythology, "
			+ "including the thrice-burnt and thrice-reborn Gullveig/Heiðr, the goddesses Gefjon, Skaði, "
			+ "Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa, Menglöð, and the 1st century CE \"Isis\" of the Suebi. Freyja's "
			+ "name appears in numerous place names in Scandinavia, with a high concentration in southern Sweden. "
			+ "Various plants in Scandinavia once bore her name, but it was replaced with the name of the Virgin "
			+ "Mary during the process of Christianization. Rural Scandinavians continued to acknowledge Freyja "
			+ "as a supernatural figure into the 19th century, and Freyja has inspired various works of art.";
	/* ************	 HEIMDALLR	*************** */
	public final String HEIMDALLR_DESC = "In Norse mythology, Heimdallr is a god who possesses the resounding "
			+ "horn Gjallarhorn, owns the golden-maned horse Gulltoppr, is called the shining god and the "
			+ "whitest of the gods, has gold teeth, and is the son of Nine Mothers (who may represent "
			+ "personified waves). Heimdallr is attested as possessing foreknowledge, keen eyesight and "
			+ "hearing, and keeps watch for invaders and the onset of Ragnarök while drinking fine mead in his "
			+ "dwelling Himinbjörg, located where the burning rainbow bridge Bifröst meets the sky. Heimdallr "
			+ "is said to be the originator of social classes among humanity and once regained Freyja's "
			+ "treasured possession Brísingamen while doing battle in the shape of a seal with Loki. Heimdallr "
			+ "and Loki are foretold to kill one another during the events of Ragnarök. Heimdallr is additionally "
			+ "referred to as Rig, Hallinskiði, Gullintanni, and Vindlér or Vindhlér.\n" + 
			"\n" + 
			"Heimdallr is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional "
			+ "material; in the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, both written in the 13th century by Snorri "
			+ "Sturluson; in the poetry of skalds; and on an Old Norse runic inscription found in England. "
			+ "Two lines of an otherwise lost poem about the god, Heimdalargaldr, survive. Due to the "
			+ "problematic and enigmatic nature of these attestations, scholars have produced various theories "
			+ "about the nature of the god, including his apparent relation to rams, that he may be a "
			+ "personification of or connected to the world tree Yggdrasil, and potential Indo-European "
			+ "cognates. ";
	/* ************		BRAGI	*************** */
	public final String BRAGI_DESC = "That Bragi is Odin's son is clearly mentioned only here and in some "
			+ "versions of a list of the sons of Odin (see Sons of Odin). But \"wish-son\" in stanza 16 of "
			+ "the Lokasenna could mean \"Odin's son\" and is translated by Hollander as Odin's kin. Bragi's "
			+ "mother is possibly the giantess Gunnlod. If Bragi's mother is Frigg, then Frigg is somewhat "
			+ "dismissive of Bragi in the Lokasenna in stanza 27 when Frigg complains that if she had a son in "
			+ "Ægir's hall as brave as Baldr then Loki would have to fight for his life.\n" + 
			"\n" + 
			"In that poem Bragi at first forbids Loki to enter the hall but is overruled by Odin. Loki then "
			+ "gives a greeting to all gods and goddesses who are in the hall save to Bragi. Bragi generously "
			+ "offers his sword, horse, and an arm ring as peace gift but Loki only responds by accusing Bragi "
			+ "of cowardice, of being the most afraid to fight of any of the Æsir and Elves within the hall. "
			+ "Bragi responds that if they were outside the hall, he would have Loki's head, but Loki only repeats "
			+ "the accusation. When Bragi's wife Iðunn attempts to calm Bragi, Loki accuses her of embracing her "
			+ "brother's slayer, a reference to matters that have not survived. It may be that Bragi had slain "
			+ "Iðunn's brother.\n" + 
			"\n" + 
			"A passage in the Poetic Edda poem Sigrdrífumál describes runes being graven on the sun, on the ear "
			+ "of one of the sun-horses and on the hoofs of the other, on Sleipnir's teeth, on bear's paw, on "
			+ "eagle's beak, on wolf's claw, and on several other things including on Bragi's tongue. Then the "
			+ "runes are shaved off and the shavings are mixed with mead and sent abroad so that Æsir have some, "
			+ "Elves have some, Vanir have some, and Men have some, these being speech runes and birth runes, "
			+ "ale runes, and magic runes. The meaning of this is obscure.\n" + 
			"\n" + 
			"The first part of Snorri Sturluson's Skáldskaparmál is a dialogue between Ægir and Bragi about the "
			+ "nature of poetry, particularly skaldic poetry. Bragi tells the origin of the mead of poetry from "
			+ "the blood of Kvasir and how Odin obtained this mead. He then goes on to discuss various poetic "
			+ "metaphors known as kennings.\n" + 
			"\n" + 
			"Snorri Sturluson clearly distinguishes the god Bragi from the mortal skald Bragi Boddason, whom "
			+ "he often mentions separately. The appearance of Bragi in the Lokasenna indicates that if these "
			+ "two Bragis were originally the same, they have become separated for that author also, or that "
			+ "chronology has become very muddled and Bragi Boddason has been relocated to mythological time. "
			+ "Compare the appearance of the Welsh Taliesin in the second branch of the Mabinogi. Legendary "
			+ "chronology sometimes does become muddled. Whether Bragi the god originally arose as a deified "
			+ "version of Bragi Boddason was much debated in the 19th century, especially by the scholars "
			+ "Eugen Mogk and Sophus Bugge. The debate remains undecided.\n" + 
			"\n" + 
			"In the poem Eiríksmál Odin, in Valhalla, hears the coming of the dead Norwegian king Eric "
			+ "Bloodaxe and his host, and bids the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli rise to greet him. Bragi "
			+ "is then mentioned, questioning how Odin knows that it is Eric and why Odin has let such a "
			+ "king die. In the poem Hákonarmál, Hákon the Good is taken to Valhalla by the valkyrie "
			+ "Göndul and Odin sends Hermóðr and Bragi to greet him. In these poems Bragi could be either "
			+ "a god or a dead hero in Valhalla. Attempting to decide is further confused because Hermóðr "
			+ "also seems to be sometimes the name of a god and sometimes the name of a hero. That Bragi "
			+ "was also the first to speak to Loki in the Lokasenna as Loki attempted to enter the hall "
			+ "might be a parallel. It might have been useful and customary that a man of great eloquence "
			+ "and versed in poetry should greet those entering a hall. He is also depicted in tenth-century "
			+ "court poetry of helping to prepare Valhalla for new arrivals and welcoming the kings who have "
			+ "been slain in battle to the hall of Odin.";
	/* ************		TYR		*************** */
	public final String TYR_DESC = "In Germanic mythology, Týr (Old Norse), Tíw (Old English), and Ziu "
			+ "(Old High German) is a god. Stemming from the Proto-Germanic deity *Tīwaz and ultimately "
			+ "from the Proto-Indo-European deity *Dyeus, little information about the god survives beyond "
			+ "Old Norse sources. Due to the etymology of the god's name and the shadowy presence of the god "
			+ "in the extant Germanic corpus, some scholars propose that Týr may have once held a more "
			+ "central place among the deities of early Germanic mythology.\n" + 
			"\n" + 
			"Týr is the namesake of the Tiwaz rune, a letter of the runic alphabet corresponding to the "
			+ "Latin letter T. By way of the process of interpretatio germanica, the deity is the namesake "
			+ "of Tuesday ('Týr's day') in Germanic languages, including English. Interpretatio romana, "
			+ "in which Romans interpret other gods as forms of their own, generally renders the god as Mars, "
			+ "the ancient Roman war god, and it is through that lens that most Latin references to the god "
			+ "occur. For example, the god may be referenced as Mars Thingsus (Latin 'Mars of the Thing') "
			+ "on 3rd century Latin inscription, reflecting a strong association with the Germanic thing, a "
			+ "legislative body among the ancient Germanic peoples still in use among some of its modern "
			+ "descendants.\n" + 
			"\n" + 
			"In Norse mythology, from which most surviving narratives about gods among the Germanic peoples "
			+ "stem, Týr sacrifices his arm to the monstrous wolf Fenrir, who bites off his limb while the "
			+ "gods bind the animal. Týr is foretold to be consumed by the similarly monstrous dog Garmr "
			+ "during the events of Ragnarök. In Old Norse sources, Týr is alternately described as the son "
			+ "of the jötunn Hymir (in Hymiskviða) or of the god Odin (in Skáldskaparmál). Lokasenna makes "
			+ "reference to an unnamed otherwise unknown consort, perhaps also reflected in the continental "
			+ "Germanic record (see Zisa (goddess)).\n" + 
			"\n" + 
			"Various place names in Scandinavia refer to the god, and a variety of objects found in England "
			+ "and Scandinavia may depict the god or invoke him. ";
